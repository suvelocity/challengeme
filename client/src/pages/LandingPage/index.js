The site is incredibly intuitive to use and I think the staff are some of the best out there, being incredibly supportive and passionate about offering a great customer experience. I can not recommend ChallengeMe highly enough.

Developing a deeper understanding of how to approach these issues is better than trying to memorize lines of code. I highly recommend ChallengeMe.

            ChallengeMe is the open-source, test based code learning program.
            Test based challenges work with industry standard technologies
            commonly found as part of QA and CI/CD systems, to check if
            submitted code holds up to scrutiny. You can create challenges and
            make them fit your needs exactly, to teach, test or evaluate the
            skills of prospective employees. If you or you team want to learn,
            teach or challenge yourselves in the world of software and web
            development, ChallengeMe is the way to go.
